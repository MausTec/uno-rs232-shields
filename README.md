# Arduino RS232 Shields

This repository contains DTE and DCE shields for the Arduino Uno and compatible devices. These shields use the hardware
serial ports and provide a 9 pin serial connector for interfacing with older electronics. Each shield has a few
variants:

- Standard Variant: RS232 exits the back (notch side) of the Arduino
- Reverse Variant: RS232 exits the front (USB side) of the Arduino

## Are these for sale?

Oh you betcha! DIY Kits and assembled shields will be available on [maustec.io](https://maustec.io).
